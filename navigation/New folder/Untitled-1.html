<h1>Bangla</h1>
<h1>Pather Panchali</h1>
<p>The Song of the Road : Both bitter and sweet in its accounts of life and relationships in the village and then in the city, the novel provided a cast of memorable characters both representative and individualistic. A lyrical and yet down-to-earth style marked a significant departure from the effusive prose favoured by Tagore and the dramatic format that Chattopadhyay had picked as its own. Very few novels can forge the kind of bond with readers that this one does.  Rating 4.3/5

<h1> Out</h1>
<p> The plot follows a young mother—who works a dead-end job in a bento factory—as she violently murders her deadbeat husband, and, subsequently, attempts to cover up the crime and outwit the detectives who are determined to catch her. The novel is a gritty, complex look at the psychology of violent crime and the lengths that people will go to to break out of dead-end circumstances. Not for the faint-hearted (tread carefully for those who aren’t a fan of graphic violence), but certainly a memorable page-turner!

<h1> A pale view of the hills    </h1>
<p>A Pale View of the Hills, follows the story of a middle-aged Japanese woman living alone in England. While dwelling on the recent suicide of her daughter, she looks inward and finds her memory returning to a summer she and her friends spent in Nagasaki, trying to rebuild life after the war. A novel set in two countries, A Pale View of the Hills is a story of the struggles of assimilation across different cultures and family transitions; a story about loss and rediscovery, and about memory — as twisted as it could get.
    Rating 3.8/5</p>

    <h1> A tale for the time being</h1>
    <p> Ruth, one of the main characters, is an author living on a remote island who stumbles across a washed-up Hello Kitty lunchbox on the beach one day. Inside she finds Nao’s story, handwritten in a journal, as well as that of her one-hundred-and-something-year-old grandmother, a Buddhist nun.

        Among the themes that Ozeki tackles are bullying, prostitution, Alzheimer’s, environmentalism, ethics, philosophy and even quantum physics. Through Nao, Ozeki explores a darker side of Japanese society.
        
        Nao is mercilessly bullied by her classmates for being an outsider (having lived in America for some years), her father becomes a hikikomori, or a hermit, eventually attempting to take his own life, while Nao herself turns to working at compensated dating cafés to escape school.Rating 4/5 </p>

<h1>Korean</h1>
 <h1>The vegeterian </h1>
<p>  This is one of the best books about Korea since it deals with the aftermath of a woman who goes against societal conventions in a drastic way.

    Yeong-hye starts dreaming of horrific, blood-soaked images and, in an effort to escape them, decides to stop eating meat. It sounds simple, but Yeong-hye’s subversive act begins to reach new heights.
    
    I think it’s best to go into The Vegetarian knowing little more than that to immerse yourself fully in the experience.Rating 3.6/5   </p>
