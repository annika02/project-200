    <h1><b> About</b></h1>
    <p> The power to be found between the pages of a book is formidable, indeed. And this website about books is here to remind you of that outside of language barrier. For, as author Anna Quindlen says, “Books are the plane, and the train, and the road. They are the destination, and the journey. They are home “That’s the thing about books. They let you travel without moving your feet.”</p>
